In one of the Discord servers I'm in, there's a channel for people to post links to their blogs, so we can all read them. My blog has an RSS feed, so one can subscribe to it using an RSS reader application (I use NetNewsWire) to get updates without having to check the site. However, I figured it'd be nice to have a bot that posts blog updates in a channel, rather than making everyone set up an RSS reader.

My first thought was to look for existing Discord RSS bots — don't reinvent the wheel and all that — but the only one with free unlimited feeds, MonitoRSS, didn't seem to be listening to me when I tried to add feeds with it. Turns out they have disabled all interaction with the bot via Discord, and you have to set up feeds in the web control panel. However, this didn't give me an option to post blog updates in a thread, so it was a bust. I resolved to write my own bot.

My friend had written [oobot](https://github.com/InternetUnexplorer/oobot), which is in the server I wanted to add an RSS bot to, and since the last time I wrote a Discord bot was so long ago that when I tried to run it, it just _didn't_, I figured I'd build off of oobot. Here's the entire source code for oobot, at the time that I wrote my bot:

```python

    # These delay values control the delay for scheduled oobs.

            channel_id: {"delay_secs": self.DELAY_MAX, "delay_task": None}
            for channel_id in channel_ids
        }

I took this oobot code and reworked it so that it would have a list of RSS feeds that it should check. I wrote all the code for handling the feeds and which channels they were being watched in before I touched actually fetching the feeds at all. So the first version looked something like this[^1]:

```python

```

To use it, you would <kbd>@RssBot add https://samasaur1.github.io/feed.xml</kbd>, you could <kbd>@RssBot list</kbd> the feeds watched in the current channel, and you could <kbd>@RssBot remove</kbd> a feed from being watched in the current channel.

Notice that this code doesn't verify that added feeds are in fact URLs, and because of that, I decided that it would check every message to make sure it was sent by me, trusting myself to not try and break it. You may also notice that that code has a bug in it, which is that it checks for authorized users before it checks whether RssBot was tagged ... so it replied to _every_ message from anyone but me with "Unauthorized user", not just the ones it was tagged in.

But before I even knew about that bug, I had already written the code to actually perform the RSS fetches. Here are the new parts:

                    raise

            # await sleep(5 * 60) #5 minutes
            await sleep(45) #5 minutes

            self.schedule_updates()

            # While unlikely, it is possible that schedule_oob() could be called
            # while the current task is in the middle of running oob() (since
            # it has a small delay to simulate typing). Running oob() in a new
            # task should prevent this.
            # create_task(self.oob(channel, None))

            # Reset the delay to the maximum and start a new delay task.
            # Restarting the task ensures that the bot will eventually send an
            # oob again even if no one else sends one.
            # self.scheduled_oobs[channel_id]["delay_secs"] = self.DELAY_MAX
            # self.schedule_oob(channel_id)

        if self.task:
            print("Canceling task")
            self.task.cancel()

        delay_task = create_task(task(), name="rssbot.update")
        self.task = delay_task
```

Important things to note: `update_status()` now calls `schedule_updates()`, which means that any time a feed is added or removed, the feeds are re-fetched.

Next, let's look at the `schedule_updates()` method. First, it creates a task that:

1. Sets the status to online
2. For each feed
    1. If the feed has never been fetched before, fetch all the current posts, mark them as fetched, and go to the next feed
    2. Fetch new entries
    3. For every channel watching this feed:
        1. Send a message for every new entry in this feed to this channel
3. Waits for 45 seconds (although there's a commented-out line here that waits for 5 minutes)
4. Calls `schedule_updates()` again

However, the task is _not_ immediately called. First, we check if there is a currently running task, and cancel it if so. Then we run the task we have created.

Also of note are the `FeedData` and `Entry` classes. The `FeedData` class is designed to keep tracke of the last fetch of a feed, so that entries are not repeated. It therefore stores the URL of the feed, the `etag` and last modified date (both of which HTTP uses to not send information more than once), and the most recent previous entry. It is the class that actually does the fetching and parsing of RSS feeds, returning new entries.

The `Entry` class represents one entry in a feed, used to determine whether entries are the same or different. The only reason that this class is necessary is because entries in a feed are essentially not guaranteed to have any field. Ideally they have a post ID, or at least a title, but they don't necessarily have either of those. In that case, I first compare the post title (if it exists), then I compare the hash of the summary (if it exists for both posts), then the hash of the content. If they have no matching fields, then we just assume that they are different. It also handles formatting outputting the entry it represents.

Changes from this initial version of RssBot to the version that's currently running[^2]:

```python
class FeedData:
    @classmethod
    def from_dict(cls, **kwargs):
        self = cls(kwargs['url'])
        self.etag = kwargs['etag']
        self.modified = kwargs['modified']
        self.previous_entry = Entry(kwargs['previous_entry'])
        return self

class RssBot(Client):
    def __init__(self, feeds: Dict[str, List[int]], feed_data: Dict[str, FeedData], **options) -> None:
        super().__init__(intents=Intents(guilds=True, messages=True), **options)
        self.feeds: Dict[str, List[int]] = feeds
        self.feed_data: Dict[str, FeedData] = feed_data

    def dump_feeds_to_file(self):
        print("Updating dump files")
        with open("feeds.json", "w") as file:
            json.dump(self.feeds, file, default=lambda o: o.__dict__, sort_keys=True, indent=4)
        with open("feeddata.json", "w") as file:
            json.dump(self.feed_data, file, default=lambda o: o.__dict__, sort_keys=True, indent=4)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    token = environ["DISCORD_TOKEN"]
    print("loaded configuration from environment...")
    print("searching for feed files in working directory")
    try:
        with open("feeds.json", "r") as file:
            feeds = json.load(file)
            print("...loaded feeds")
    except:
        print("...feeds not found")
        feeds = {}
    try:
        with open("feeddata.json", "r") as file:
            feed_data = json.load(file)
            print("...loaded feed data")
    except:
        print("...feed data not found")
        feed_data = {}
    feed_data = {feed: FeedData.from_dict(**feed_data[feed]) for feed in feed_data.keys()}
    print("connecting to Discord...")
    RssBot(feeds, feed_data).run(token)
```
These changes store the feeds and the channels they're configured to output to, along with the most recent post from these feeds (and their latest modification dates). That way, when the bot restarts, it remembers which channels it's been configured in, and doesn't re-fetch if unnecessary.

Assorted other changes:
```python
async def update_status(self) -> None:
        feed_count = len(self.feeds)
        stat = Status.idle if feed_count == 0 else Status.online
        fstr = "1 feed" if feed_count == 1 else f"{feed_count} feeds"
        await self.change_presence(status=stat, activity=Activity(name=fstr, type=ActivityType.watching))
```
The bot is now online if and only if it is watching any feeds; otherwise it is idle.

```python
if message.author.id != 377776843425841153:
            print(f"Request from {message.author} ({message.author.id})")
            await say(message, "Unauthorized user")
            return
```
This bit above was removed, so that everyone can interact with the bot. At the same time, we validated URLs like so:
```python
if validators.url(url):
    self.feeds[url] = [message.channel.id]
    print("Now watching feed (new feed)")
    self.dump_feeds_to_file()
    await self.update_status()
    await say(message, f"Now watching {url} in this channel")
else:
    print("Invalid URL")
    await say(message, f"Not a valid URL")
```

I also added some admin commands that only I can run, and set the delay to 5 minutes.

***

At the moment, RssBot is running in a `screen` on one of my NixOS servers. If I manage to get it set up properly as a NixOS service, I'll probably write a blog post on that as well.

Furthermore, this post is going to be the first test of this bot on an actual blog, so let's really hope it works!

[^1]: I don't actually have any version of RssBot before it could actually check RSS feeds, so this is a reconstruction from the first commit in my Git repo.
[^2]: I've snipped and clipped the other changes. To actually see the code as it was when I wrote this article, [check out the GitHub](https://github.com/Samasaur1/rssbot/blob/784c3cd3a9d1c297b657edb3628aa2678a8dfc1c/main.py). Or [look at the latest version](https://github.com/Samasaur1/rssbot/blob/main/main.py), in case I've updated it more.
