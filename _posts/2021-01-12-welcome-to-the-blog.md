Hello there! Welcome to my Brand New Blog!

![John Mulaney waving enthusiastically]({{ "/assets/images/blog/john-mulaney-waving.gif" | relative_url }})

I hope you're excited to be reading this, because I'm excited to be writing it. Let's get some information down about the blog/site/me:

* There is no guarantee that I will write anything here on any sort of schedule — I could be busy, or I could be "busy". Hopefully, what I do write will be interesting, though.
* Blog topics will probably range wildly. I expect a lot of technical stuff (such as "How did I do this project?"), but there will also liekly be other areas. I will try to tag posts well.
* Speaking of tags, at the time of writing, they are all this teal color:
<br/>![screen shot of tags]({{ "/assets/images/blog/example-tags-image.png" | relative_url }})<br/>
and link to 404 pages (see how I cleverly framed it as deliberate?). These are both planned to change in the future. Ideally, if I get tags for specific programming languages, they will match the color found on [the projects page]({{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}) for that language (which in turn matches GitHub). Tags may link to their own collection pages, or may link nowhere at all. I reserve the right to make that decision later.
* I have a habit of Capitalizing Some Words in Sentences in order to Emphasize Specific Ideas. I'm pretty sure I picked it up from Winnie the Pooh (self-described as "a Bear of Very Little Brain"), so if you think you've seen it before, that might be where.
* This website is build by Jekyll, and is hosted on GitHub Pages. This means that the entire website is version-controlled — anything you see on it will be in the history. You can see the project [here](https://github.com/Samasaur1/samasaur1.github.io). I don't plan to mess with the history unless I accidentally publish confidential information (e.g., passwords).
* That said, despite everything being backed up, posts have a date that they were "written on", and so I don't plan to drastically change them after that date. I'll probably correct spelling/grammar without noting it, I'll make things clearer and put a note, and I'll post "Redux" posts (or some other name) if a large explanation is required.
* Expect some upcoming posts on how I made this site, I guess. (when I say "how I made", you should think "what weird/cool things he's doing").
