<h1>Hello and welcome to my personal webpage!</h1>
<p>
The aim of this web page is to document all of my particular obsessions regarding the wonderful field that is Information Technology.
It is not meant to be especially pretty or full of features, although I might keep adding some as time goes on.
</p>
<p>
 I will be posting mainly in english, but I will try to add spanish/english support in the future.
 <ul>
    <li>This is <a href="{{ "/projects" | relative_url }}">the project list page</a></li>
    <li>This is <a href="{{ "/blog" | relative_url }}">the blog</a> </li>
 </ul>
  The blog will be getting much more activity than the project page, since I love to dump information from my brain into some text form.
</p>
<p>
You can read more about me on <a href="{{ "/about" | relative_url }}">the about page</a>.
